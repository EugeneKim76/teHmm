These are parameters for initializing a TE model that is based on class names from the Chaux RepeatMasker track.  The initial distributions

chauxEmissionInit.dist and chauxTransitionInit.dist

were generated with createStartingModel.py as run on the chaux track with default options.  The model was edited by hand to replace the LTR state with a 3-state based LTR model similar to the ltrfinder track.  Two further "lastz" states were added for termini matches that don't necessarily bookend LTR TEs.

The initial start distribution was created by hand and forces the model to always start in the Outside state. 

An example training command line for this model is 

teHmmTrain.py ../../mustang_alyrata_tracks_clean.xml /data/glenn.hickey/genomes/alyrata/tracks/manual/manualChaux.bed manualChaux.mod --initTransProbs chauxTransitionInit.dist --initEmProbs chauxEmissionInit.dist --initStartProbs chauxStartInit.dist --fixStart --flatEm

Note the second parameter is a bed file specifying regions of the genome to train on.  

To run the above within in the benchmark framework (which also generates an annotation and compares it with some gold standard), run teHmmBenchmark.py on the same input as above (use --help to note slightly different syntax for output)
